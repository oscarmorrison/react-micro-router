## Looking for fellow contributors

I am hoping to build the go to alternative to React Router, a light weight clean, simple router for use in all your projects.
If you are interested in contributing, or share similiar [goals](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/react-micro-router/wiki#goal) send me an email or just start contributing.
